# Udacity CARND Term 2 Project 5 - Model Predictive Control

In this project is was necessary to use the supplied Udacity simulator in order to steer a virtual vehicle around a track using model predictive control. This is an advanced method of control relying on the fact that there is a level of certainty concerning the mathematical model of the system, which in this case would be the kinematic equations of a vehicle.
